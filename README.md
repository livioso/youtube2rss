> Download a Youtube channel and build a RSS podcast feed for it.

### Motivation ğŸ¤”
My growing number of Youtube Channel Subscriptions caused a lot of
frustration with the official Youtube app. The app doesn't allow me
to download videos. Neither is it possible to resume playback nor
can I play a video when the app is not on screen. Features that my
podcast client of choice, PocketCasts already has.

So the solution is simple, just get all the Youtube Subscriptions to
my podcast client. This is exactly what this script does:

- Download all videos from a channel (within a given date range).
- Build a subscribe-able [iTunes RSS feed](http://www.itunes.com/dtds/podcast-1.0.dtd)
  which is compatible with any Podcast client.
- Optional: Delete old episodes to save precious disk space.

### Getting Started ğŸš€

- `docker build -t youtube2rss .`
- `docker run -it youtube2rss:latest`

### Configuration example `example.json`ğŸ”§
